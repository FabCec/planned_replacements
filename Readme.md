# Predictive Maintenance of Hard-Drive Disks

We aim to understand whether it is possible to predict the failure of HDDs by observing the evolution of their SMART metrics. 

We deployed code and slides.

## Slides
In 'Slides_Planned_Replacement.pdf', we provide an overview of the project

## Code
We provide four separate notebooks. 

- 1. Introduction and motivation.ipynb: Introduction, motivation, and guidelines of the project
- 2. Data wrangling.ipynb: Load the datasets and perform a preliminary feature selection
- 3. Exploratory data analysis and inferential statistic.ipynb: Perform EDA and inferential statistic
- 4. Machine learning and optimization problem.ipynb: Present the learning models and derive the predictiv replacement policies
